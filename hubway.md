# Hubway- Bike sharing analysis

I have used this data set from the already available on the internet.
This is my first exposure to use SQL as my dataset in python to perform exploratory 
analysis and use matplotlib.pyplot to visualize it.  

The libraries used in this file is sqlite3, pandas and matplotlib.

I loaded the SQL table in a dataFrame and ran queries over it to answer these questions from trips table:

# What was the duration of the longest trip?
# How many trips were taken by registered users?
# What was the average trip duration?
# Do registered or casual users take longer trips?
# Which bike was used for the most trips?
# What is the average duration of trips by users over the age of 30? 

then I ran queries over the other table named stations to answer these questions:

#  which station has been visited the most?
#  which are the different municipalities?
# which municipality has most no of stations ?

I have also used bar chart at required places to picturize the data for a better understanding.

The SQL commands used in this analysis include:
## SELECT
## WHERE
## LIMIT
## ORDER BY
## GROUP BY
## AND
## OR
## MIN
## MAX
## AVG
## SUM
## COUNT
